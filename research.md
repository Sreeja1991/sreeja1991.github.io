### Research Interests

- Membrane physics
- Lipid bilayers and phase behavior
- Protein-lipid interactions
- Cryo-SEM and AFM imaging of membranes
- Hydrodynamics in biological systems
- Interaction of bioactive molecules with lipid membranes

My work spans experimental soft matter physics and biophysics, using advanced imaging, microfluidics, and spectroscopy tools.
