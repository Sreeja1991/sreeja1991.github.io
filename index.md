Welcome to my academic homepage. I am an experimental biophysics. I use microscopy, microfluidics and lipid biochemistry to understand the intricate nature of cell membranes. Lipids are fascinating molecules, which self assemble to form protective external membrane of the living cells. During my Ph.D. at Raman Research Instiute under the guidance of V.A. Raghunathan, I studied how lipid interact with different biomolecules using mainly x-ray scattering experiments. That where I fell in love lipid molecules. I was super curious about how nature design this molecule. It form a protection cellular interior. Just basic physics is enough heal minute pores formes in bilayer. It is resistant enough for logitudinal streching acting as solid and the same time it is fluid enough have random movement or "diffusion" at physiological temperature. There is a lot we know about them, a lot need to be explored more. 
Then you can ask me? Why do we need to study about them in so details. Why not a simple understanding of their nature is enough?
This question bioled down a REALLY big fascinating question. "HOW CELL WORKS?" 
A cell is the basic building of any life form. It has birth -> life -> death cycle. Even it can make may important decision itself about how to should behave like we do.
How muchever tiny they are, they hide the secret how life works.
Fascianting is it. That is where I decide I want to work on Biophysics.
